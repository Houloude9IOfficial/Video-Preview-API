# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is the first post on my new portfolio site.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a portfolio that reflects who I am as a developer, not just a static resume, but an **interactive experience**. Something that shows what I can build, not just what I can list.

## The Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** — App router, server components, and blazing fast performance
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling with a custom dark theme
- **Framer Motion** — Smooth scroll animations and transitions
- **shadcn/ui patterns** — Clean, accessible component design
- **MDX** — Blog posts written in Markdown with React components

## The Interactive Terminal

My favorite feature is the interactive terminal in the hero section. Try typing `help` to see what it can do. There might even be some hidden commands...

## What Was Hard

<!-- TODO: Fill in what was challenging about building this project -->

## Other Notes

<!-- TODO: Add any additional notes, lessons learned, or observations -->

## What's Next

I'll be using this blog to share my development journey, technical deep-dives, and project updates. Stay tuned!
